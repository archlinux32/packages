# segfaults in ld of binutils 2.30 needs the binutils_2_30 branch
# for now, see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23194
# this patch was done by diffing the branch against the tag and removing
# some conflicts, also 0003-PR22836-r-s-doesnt-work-with-g3-using-GCC-7.patch
# needs disabling because it has already been cherry-picked into the branch.
# cherry-picking onlt the fix for P23194 leads to assertion violations in
# the GOT, so this was not done.
